# SMA Constitutive Model â€“ 1D (Replication Study)

This repository contains a Python implementation of the **one-dimensional constitutive model for shape-memory alloys (SMAs)** proposed by **Sadjadpour and Bhattacharya (2007)**.  
The code reproduces the stressâ€“strain responses and phase-transformation behavior reported in the original paper, using a **4th-order Rungeâ€“Kutta (RK4) integration scheme**.
